# Section Routing Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed "View All Products" Button
- **File**: `src/pages/Store.tsx`
- **Change**: Removed the "View All Products" button from the products section header
- **Reason**: Simplifies the UI and keeps users on the store page

### 2. Improved Section Routing
- **File**: `src/lib/scroll-to-section.ts`
- **Change**: Updated scroll behavior to always use `block: 'start'` to ensure scrolling to the beginning of the section
- **Enhancement**: Forces scroll to start at the top of the target section

### 3. Reduced Scroll Offset
- **Files**: `src/pages/Store.tsx`, `src/pages/Products.tsx`
- **Change**: Reduced offset from `80px` to `20px` in scroll-to-section calls
- **Reason**: Ensures users land at the very beginning of the products section

### 4. Updated Navigation Flow
- **File**: `src/pages/Index.tsx`
- **Change**: Collection links now navigate to `/store?collection=...` instead of `/products?collection=...`
- **Reason**: Maintains consistency with the removal of the "View All Products" button

## Technical Details

### Scroll-to-Section Configuration
```typescript
scrollToSectionWithRetry('products', {
  behavior: 'smooth',
  offset: 20, // Reduced from 80px to ensure beginning of section
  timeout: 300
});
```

### Navigation Flow
```
Home Page Collection Links → /store?collection=name → Products Section
```

### Scroll Behavior
- **Primary Method**: `scrollIntoView({ block: 'start' })`
- **Fallback Method**: Manual `window.scrollTo()` with calculated position
- **Offset**: 20px (minimal offset for visual spacing)
- **Retry Mechanism**: Up to 3 attempts with increasing timeout

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner UI**: Removed unnecessary button clutter
2. **Better UX**: Users land exactly at the beginning of the products section
3. **Consistent Navigation**: All collection links follow the same pattern
4. **Reliable Scrolling**: Enhanced scroll-to-section utility ensures consistent behavior
