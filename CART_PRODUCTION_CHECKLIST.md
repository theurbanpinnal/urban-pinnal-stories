# ðŸš€ Cart Production Synchronization Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Verification

### Environment Variables âœ…
- [ ] `VITE_SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN` is set in production
- [ ] `VITE_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_API_TOKEN` is set and valid
- [ ] Environment variables are accessible in Vercel/Netlify dashboard
- [ ] API token has correct permissions (read/write cart operations)

### API Configuration âœ…
- [ ] `/api/shopify` route is properly configured
- [ ] Vercel rewrite rule `/shopify/(.*)` â†’ `/api/shopify` is active
- [ ] API route handles all cart operations (GET_CART, CREATE_CART, ADD_TO_CART, etc.)
- [ ] CORS headers are properly configured

### localStorage Fallback âœ…
- [ ] Cart ID storage works across browser sessions
- [ ] Fallback to sessionStorage if localStorage fails
- [ ] Storage validation prevents corrupted data
- [ ] Clear cart functionality works properly

## Production Monitoring

### Error Handling âœ…
- [ ] Network timeouts are handled (10s timeout configured)
- [ ] Retry logic with exponential backoff is active
- [ ] User-friendly error messages are shown
- [ ] GraphQL errors are properly logged and handled

### Logging & Analytics âœ…
- [ ] Cart sync events are logged with timestamps
- [ ] Failed operations are tracked
- [ ] Health checks run every 5 minutes
- [ ] Page visibility changes trigger cart sync

## User Experience

### Loading States âœ…
- [ ] Loading indicators show during cart operations
- [ ] Buttons are disabled during operations
- [ ] Visual feedback for successful operations
- [ ] Error states provide clear guidance

### Offline Support âœ…
- [ ] Cart operations queue when offline
- [ ] Online/offline events trigger appropriate actions
- [ ] Network recovery syncs pending operations

## Testing Checklist

### Functional Tests âœ…
- [ ] Add item to cart â†’ Verify persistence
- [ ] Update item quantity â†’ Verify sync
- [ ] Remove item from cart â†’ Verify update
- [ ] Clear cart â†’ Verify complete removal
- [ ] Page refresh â†’ Verify cart restoration

### Edge Cases âœ…
- [ ] Network interruption during operation
- [ ] Invalid cart ID in localStorage
- [ ] Shopify API rate limiting
- [ ] Browser private/incognito mode
- [ ] Multiple tabs open simultaneously

### Performance âœ…
- [ ] Cart loads within 3 seconds on page load
- [ ] Operations complete within 2 seconds
- [ ] No memory leaks from retry logic
- [ ] Bundle size impact is minimal

## Production Deployment Steps

1. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   # Verify environment variables
   echo $VITE_SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN
   echo $VITE_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_API_TOKEN
   ```

2. **Build Verification**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # Check for any cart-related build errors
   ```

3. **API Testing**
   ```bash
   # Test API endpoint directly
   curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/shopify \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"query": "query { shop { name } }"}'
   ```

4. **Browser Testing**
   - [ ] Chrome/Firefox/Safari/Edge compatibility
   - [ ] Mobile devices (iOS/Android)
   - [ ] Slow network conditions
   - [ ] Airplane mode (offline testing)

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Cart operation success rate (>99%)
- Average response time (<2s)
- Error rate by operation type
- Cart abandonment rate
- Page load time with cart

### Alert Conditions
- Cart sync failure rate >5%
- API response time >5 seconds
- localStorage corruption detected
- Environment variable missing

## Rollback Plan

If cart synchronization fails in production:

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Check Vercel function logs
   - Verify environment variables
   - Monitor Shopify API status

2. **User Impact Mitigation**
   - Show offline mode message
   - Allow manual cart recovery
   - Provide customer support contact

3. **Code Rollback**
   - Revert to previous working version
   - Keep cart data intact during rollback
   - Monitor recovery after rollback

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Cart loads consistently across all devices
- [ ] Operations complete within 2 seconds
- [ ] No cart data loss during network issues
- [ ] Error messages are helpful and actionable
- [ ] Performance doesn't degrade over time
